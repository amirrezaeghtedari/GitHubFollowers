# GitHubUsers
This is a sample project that uses the Github API to:

* search for Github users using their username.
* show users' info.
* show users' followers.
* and saving users to the favorite list.

The app architecture is based on clean architecture and contains no third party library.

This application has been created based on a training course, which is called iOS Deve Job Interview Practice - Take Home Project, created by Sean Allen. The original application is called GHFollowers. The current app workflow and architecture differ from the original one almost completely.

You can find the GHFollowers training course here:
